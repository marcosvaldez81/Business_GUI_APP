# Business_GUI_APP
I deep dove into Data Analytics  by creating a Business GUI App in which was backed by free Kaggle datasets.

How to use this GUI_APP:

1. Download the CSV and python files

2. Need to make sure all files are in same directory.

3. Run the finalproject.py and make sure all csv files are NOT open.

4. Input in required fields then check out the calculations csv !

Thanks,
